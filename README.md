# ComplexSystemProject

This is a project for the Complex System Design course of the Master's degree in Computer Science at the University of Camerino.

## Project Description

The aim of this work is to develop a detailed simulation of a complex embedded system
designed to manage blockchain transactions and certify the origin of products, as in the
case of fishing, where it is essential to certify the provenance of fish to guarantee quality. 
This system is based on coroutines, allowing efficient and concurrent management of
transactions, and includes probabilistic, non-deterministic and deterministic events to
represent the variations and uncertainties that can occur during operation.

The main objective of simulation is to faithfully reproduce the behaviour of the system,
thus allowing stress tests to be carried out at various workloads. This approach is cru
cial for identifying the ‘breaking load’ of the hardware specification, that is the point
beyond which system performance starts to degrade. The results of these simulations
are used not only to assess the current performance of the hardware in use, but also
to provide clear and practical indications regarding the need for any hardware upgrades.

This work aims to provide an overview of the dynamics of a coroutine and blockchain
based embedded system, highlighting the importance of realistic simulations to ensure
optimal and reliable operation. The information obtained from the testing of the sys
tem will help to improve operational efficiency and ensure the certification of the origin
of products, thus meeting the growing demands for transparency and traceability in
the modern market.
